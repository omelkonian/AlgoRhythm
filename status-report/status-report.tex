\section{Techniques}

\subsection{Main Datatypes}
For representing music, we defined a highly-abstract \icode{Music} datatype, polymorphic to the specific elements of music manipulated through time. Hence, this datatype only specifies the operations invariant across all such specific representation, such as sequential/parallel composition of music and basic construction of music events or silence (of a certain duration), as shown below:

\begin{center}\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}\begin{minted}[baselinestretch=1.1, fontsize=\small]{haskell}
data Music a = Music a :+: Music a
             | Music a :=: Music a
             | Note Duration a
             | Rest Duration
\end{minted}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

For instance, in Western classical music it would appropriate to instantiate this type with an element representing 
musical notes, represented as pairs of the pitch class (one of the 12 available ones) and the octave (how low/high is this note played). In South India's vocal tradition \textit{Konnakol}, on the other hand, one would only care about the rhythmic values (i.e. the durations), thus \icode{Music ()} would be more intuitive.

This freedom essentially enable us to choose the abstraction level we wish our music programs to be written in. Most importantly, we define a core representation \icode{MusicCore}, which is what every other abstraction should convert to, in order to allow for rendering/exporting in different formats. The typeclass is given below:

\begin{center}\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}\begin{minted}[baselinestretch=1.1, fontsize=\small]{haskell}
class ToMusicCore a where
  toMusicCore :: Music a -> MusicCore
\end{minted}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

We, naturally, focus on western music and define further helpful types/synonyms to represent common concepts encountered in music theory and practice (+ their conversions to \icode{MusicCore}). Furthermore, we provide operations often used in algorithmic music composition, such as transposition, inversion, mirroring, scaling and repetition. These are implemented as typeclasses, in order to allow user-defined \icode{Music} instances to extend them.

Last but not least, we provide commonly-used \textit{constants} of these musical concepts, such as popular scales/chords/durations.

\subsection{Libraries}
In order to avoid re-inventing the wheel, we utilized pre-existing Haskell libraries for exporting to MIDI/score formats. Specifically, we use \textbf{lilypond}\site{https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lilypond} to export music to Lilypond's digital score format, which can then be easily converted to PDF, etc... To enable MIDI export and music playback, we use \textbf{Euterpea}\site{https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Euterpea}. Since each of these libraries defines their own music datatype, integrating them entails converting from our \icode{MusicCore} type, which could be easily and naturally covered by the target types. For testing, we use HUnit\site{https://hackage.haskell.org/package/HUnit} and QuickCheck\site{https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck}.

\section{Achievements}
Thus far, our main achievements are an extensive DSL for representing/transforming music and the ability to export in MIDI and score formats.
Design and implementation of the Generation DSL has started, but is still incomplete. Our code is available on Github\site{https://github.com/omelkonian/afp-project}.

\subsection{Music DSL}
We have implemented a rather expressive, but simple, EDSL for representing music and transformation. To give you a taste of the available operators, let us consider the example of expressing the harmonic progression of a famous song structure, known as the \textit{12-bar blues}. Given a particular tonic (i.e. note), one can derive 12 bars of chords, moving only between three basic (dominant) chords (I, IV and V) in a certain order. Moving from the tonic to the other ones is achieved simply by transposing a \icode{Chord} by a certain \icode{Interval}. The program expressing this structure is given below:
\begin{minted}[baselinestretch=1.1, fontsize=\small]{haskell}
-- Useful type synonyms
type Chord = [Pitch] ; type Melody = Music Pitch ; type Harmony = Music Chord
-- Abstract harmonic structure
bluesProgression :: Pitch -> Harmony
bluesProgression p =
  let tonic = p=|d7 <| wn
  in  line $ map ($ tonic) [id, id, id, id, (~> P4), (~> P4), id, id, (~> P5), (~> P5), id, id]
-- Concrete harmonic structure (Repeat C blues progression four times)
cBlues :: Harmony
cBlues = 4 ## bluesProgression (C#3)
\end{minted}
Given a way to improvise over such $D7$ chords, i.e. a function of type \icode{Chord -> Melody}, one could derive an improvisation line on top of this harmony, as demonstrated below:
\begin{minted}[baselinestretch=1.1, fontsize=\small]{haskell}
-- Parallel composition of harmonic progression and improvisation line (played an octave higher)
cBluesImprov :: Melody
cBluesImprov = chords cBlues :=: flatten (improviseOverD7 <$> cBlues) ~> P8
-- Create a line from a 4-note chord (we use postfix operators for silence)
improviseOverD7 :: Chord -> Melody
improviseOverD7 [a, b, c, d] =
  a <| qn :+: (b <~ Mi2) <| en :+: b <| en :+: (c <| qn :=: d <| qn) :+: (en~~) :+: d <| en
\end{minted}
We attached the generated score (i.e. \icode{writeToLilypond cBluesImprov}) in the Appendix.

\section{Planning}
We are more or less on track with our initial planning, but we realised we cannot tackle Generation and Constraints separately. Thus, we decided to aim for a more integrated and iterative solution, where we gradually design/implement the GenDSL with constraints in mind. Since this task is not easily distributed amongst us, we will simultaneously work on GenDSL applications (i.e. chaotic systems, probabilistic rewriting grammars) from week 4 onwards, retrospectively adapting to new requirements we may encounter. Finally, the last week will be solely devoted to finalizing examples/applications.
